This is a implementation of simple Molecular Dynamics Simulation on water. Many factors like bond torsion, pressure, pH, proper periodic boundary etc. are not considered.

------------------------------------
The implementation folder consists of a sample MD Simulation with series and parallel implementaion.
Time check folder consists of various simulations with varied atomic numbers, simulation box size and simulation time.
